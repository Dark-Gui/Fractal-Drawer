To Compile and run your program,Open terminal and locate the folder where teh project is in.Then type javac FractalDrawer.java in the terminal.
Then type java FractalDrawer then the terminal will run FractalDrawer.java.

One additional feature I implemented was to randomize the color of my Fractal Drawing.

There is a bug where you have to drag the canvas to get the full picture for the fractal.This bug is only for Circle

– idea1: I got the idea to randomise my colors from stack overflow website.
